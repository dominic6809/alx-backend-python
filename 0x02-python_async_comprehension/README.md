# 0x02-python_async_comprehension

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of asynchronous programming in Python, specifically focusing on asynchronous generators and comprehensions. The project demonstrates how to write asynchronous code to handle non-blocking operations, collect data asynchronously, and annotate types for better code quality and documentation.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Write an asynchronous generator in Python.
- Use async comprehensions to collect data.
- Type-annotate generators for clarity and type safety.

## Requirements
- Python version: `3.7` (or manual event loop handling for Python `3.6.x`)
- All files must be executable and follow the PEP 8 style guide.
- Mandatory documentation for all modules, functions, and coroutines.
- Code will be tested using `pycodestyle` (version 2.5.x).
